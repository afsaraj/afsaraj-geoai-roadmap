# 🛰️ GeoAI Roadmap – Satellite & Geospatial Intelligence – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal  
Master the tools and techniques to apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning on **satellite imagery, spatial data**, and **environmental signals** — for use in agriculture, defense, disaster response, and climate.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Satellite & Geospatial Data Basics

**🌍 Core Concepts**
- [ ] Raster vs Vector Data
- [ ] Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS, EPSG)
- [ ] Geotiffs, Shapefiles, GeoJSON
- [ ] Map projections, tiles, bounding boxes

**🧰 Tools**
- Rasterio, GDAL, Geopandas, Shapely, Fiona

**📦 Project Idea:**  
Visualize and convert geospatial data between formats, clip by bounding box

## 📍 Phase 2: Remote Sensing & Image Preprocessing

**🛰️ Satellite Data Sources**
- [ ] Sentinel-2, Landsat, MODIS
- [ ] OpenStreetMap
- [ ] NOAA, NASA Earthdata
- [ ] Commercial APIs (SkyWatch, Planet Labs)

**Processing**
- [ ] NDVI, NDWI (vegetation, water indexes)
- [ ] Cloud masking, band stacking, mosaicking
- [ ] Spectral band analysis (RGB, NIR, SWIR)

**📦 Project Idea:**  
Build NDVI time series for crop monitoring using Sentinel-2 images

## 📍 Phase 3: Machine Learning on Satellite Imagery

**📊 ML Applications**
- [ ] Land cover classification (supervised learning)
- [ ] Flood, fire, deforestation detection
- [ ] Change detection over time

**🧠 Tools**
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Deep learning: PyTorch, Keras, fastai

**📦 Project Idea:**  
Use ML to classify urban vs rural regions based on satellite image tiles
